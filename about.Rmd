## Bio

Dr. Gonzalo Pérez-Rosales is a quantitative coral reef ecologist, oceanographer and TEK Diver with a high interest in the depth gradient of marine ecosystems. 

After a B.Sc. in Marine Science – Oceanography in the Canary Islands, I moved to Australia, where I joined the amazing world of Coral Reefs. Following academic volunteering programs and after being a fieldwork team member for "Chasing Coral", I committed myself to the world of Coral Reefs Research and Communication. 
Finishing a M.Sc. in Biodiversity and Environmental Management of Coral Reefs between France and French Polynesia. 
I completed a Ph.D. at EPHE-PSL at the CRIOBE focusing on the Mesophotic Coral Ecosystems of French Polynesia, again between French Polynesia and France.
During my thesis entitled: **Diving deep on the reef slopes in French Polynesia: new insights into mesophotic coral ecosystems.** I was under the supervision of Laetitia Hédouin and Valeriano Parravicini. This thesis was possible thanks to the DEEPHOPE expedition and project with the Under The Pole team, for which I was an offshore scientist collecting data for my thesis and for others. The thesis was mostly carried out in French Polynesia. 

I am currently looking for PostDoc opportunities. 
My ultimate goal is to provide empirical research and tools for science-based decision actions for the oceans' future with global changes.
