## Making it to the cover of newspapers around the world 

Richard Vevers [The ocean Agency](https://www.theoceanagency.org/) took this picture of me while filming bleaching on Lizard Island during the production of [Chasing Coral](https://www.chasingcoral.com/). Since then, this picture has been featured in many international journals, including the New York Times, BBC, The Guardian, etc. The experience with Chasing Coral convinced me how important communication is for scientists. I firmly believe the general public should know what we are doing as scientists. People have the right to be aware, and we must pass the message, so please reach out if you work in science communication.

## Espa√±oles por el mundo 

The main Spanish TV channel RTVE1, followed my life during my PhD in French Polynesia. 

You can watch the film in Spanish [here](https://www.rtve.es/play/videos/espanoles-en-el-mundo/islas-de-tahiti/6103712/), where I talk about my research and my day a day life. If you don't have time, watch the [shorter version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLif2JUu_bk&t=12s&ab_channel=Espa%C3%B1olesenelmundo) or the  [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3leBCDYbWg&ab_channel=Espa%C3%B1olesenelmundo) and keep it for the future.
