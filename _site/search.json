During my thesis entitled: Diving deep on the reef slopes in French Polynesia: new insights into mesophotic coral ecosystems. I was under the supervision of Laetitia Hédouin and Valeriano Parravicini. This thesis was possible thanks to the DEEPHOPE expedition and project with the Under The Pole team, for which I was an offshore scientist collecting data for my thesis and for others. The thesis was mostly carried out in French Polynesia.\n            I am currently looking for PostDoc opportunities.
